| This is based on the first project from the course. Since I have done the lesson in the past, and learned a few things since then I implemented it a little differently then the instructor showed. Still nothing I'd brag about, but still happy I could look at what the result should be and create this on my own. | <img width="450" alt="Screen Shot 2022-07-31 at 11 10 55 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20800253/182083387-9acef37a-7ded-4f33-8f67-fa0f8dea76a1.png"> |
